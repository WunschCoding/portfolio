      <p>
        The Pomeranian (also known as a Pom, Pommy or Pome) is a breed of dog of
        the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west
        Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog
        breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger
        Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. <br />The breed has been
        made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen
        Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian, and consequently, the
        smaller variety became universally popular. During Victoria's lifetime
        alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. As of 2017, in terms of
        registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among
        the top fifty most popular breeds in the United States, and the current
        fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.
